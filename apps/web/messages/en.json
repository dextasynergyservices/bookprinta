    "q1": "What is BookPrinta?",
    "a1": "BookPrinta is a professional book publishing platform designed for Nigerian authors. We take your raw manuscript (DOCX or PDF) and transform it into a beautifully formatted, print-ready book — handling everything from typesetting to printing and delivery.",
    "q2": "How does the publishing process work?",
    "a2": "It's simple: upload your manuscript, choose a package, and we handle the rest. Our AI-powered engine cleans and formats your text, generates a professional layout, and you get to preview every page before approving for print. Once approved, your book is printed and delivered within days.",
    "q3": "What file formats do you accept?",
    "a3": "We accept DOCX (Microsoft Word) and PDF files up to 10MB. We recommend DOCX for the best formatting results, as our engine can better parse and reformat the text.",
    "q4": "Can I get an ISBN for my book?",
    "a4": "Yes! ISBN registration is available as an add-on with our Glow Up and Legacy packages. It's automatically included with the Legacy package. An ISBN makes your book discoverable in global book databases.",
    "q5": "Do you design book covers?",
    "a5": "Cover design is included in our Glow Up and Legacy packages. For the First Draft package, you can provide your own cover design. We also offer custom cover design as a standalone add-on service.",
    "q6": "How much does it cost to publish a book?",
    "a6": "We offer three packages starting from affordable rates. The First Draft package covers basic formatting and printing, the Glow Up adds professional cover design and ISBN, and the Legacy package includes everything plus premium finishing. Visit our pricing page for detailed pricing.",
    "q7": "What payment methods do you accept?",
    "a7": "We accept bank transfers, Paystack (cards, USSD, mobile money), and Stripe for international payments. PayPal is also available for international authors.",
    "q8": "Can I get a custom quote?",
    "a8": "Absolutely! If your project has unique requirements — special paper stock, large print runs, unusual trim sizes, or premium finishing — use our custom quote form and we'll get back to you within 24 hours with a tailored proposal.",
    "q9": "How long does printing take?",
    "a9": "Standard turnaround is 72 hours after you approve your book preview. During peak periods, it may take slightly longer — we'll notify you if there are any delays. Rush printing is available on request.",
    "q10": "What is the minimum order quantity?",
    "a10": "The minimum order is 25 copies. This allows us to maintain professional print quality while keeping prices affordable. For larger quantities, we offer volume discounts.",
    "q11": "Can I reprint my book?",
    "a11": "Yes! Once your book is published, you can reprint it at any time from your dashboard. You can choose to reprint the exact same version or make revisions before reprinting.",
    "q12": "What is your refund policy?",
    "a12": "We offer refunds on a case-by-case basis. If there's a quality issue with your printed books, contact us and we'll make it right. Refunds are not available after you've approved the final preview, as manufacturing begins immediately.",
    "q13": "How can I contact BookPrinta?",
    "a13": "You can reach us through our contact page, WhatsApp, or email. We typically respond within a few hours during business days. For urgent matters, WhatsApp is the fastest way to reach our team.",
